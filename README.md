# fairml-farm
A collection of implementations of fair ML algorithms.
To begin with, we'll be dealing exclusively with fairness in classification.

TODO:
* Come up with a list of methods to initially implement
* Create helper routines to
** Fetch data
** Evaluate + visualize results


Types of fair ML algorithms:
* Learned representations
* Modified loss functions
* Learned objectives
